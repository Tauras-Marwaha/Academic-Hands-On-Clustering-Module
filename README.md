# Academic-Hands-On-Clustering-Module
A Hands on academic exercise around the fundamentals of different clustering algorithms

Language: Python 3

Course: Intelligent Data Analysis (CS 6052) taught by Dr. Gowtham Atluri

Goal: Learn, implement, evaluate and reason out results of different clustering algorithms - KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models.

Data: Self generated multiple datasets - Blobs, Moons, Embedded circles, Random

Approach: We have been provided with datasets and interesting questions that need to be answered by understanding the fundamentals of the different algorithms. A sample practise module was also provided by the professor to guide us with some sample codes and help us getting started.

Acknowledgement: This assignment was designed by Dr. Gowtham Atluri as a part of requirement for CS 6052 - Intelligent Data Analysis course, taught at the University of Cincinnati.

Score: 9.5/10
